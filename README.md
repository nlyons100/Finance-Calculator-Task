# Finance-Calculator-Task
	**Project description**: An example python program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators - an investment calculator and a home lone repayment calculator. 
	**Installation**: Download this python file and open the program in Visual Studio Code. 
	**Detailed project description for investment calculator**: The investment python program allows the user to calculate the amount of interest earned on their original investment. 
It uses the python formula A= P*math.pow((1+r), t) where r= interest entered by the user divided by 100, P=the amount the user deposits, t=the number of years that the money is being invested and A=the total amount once the interest has been applied. 
The program then prints the answer to the user. 
	**Detailed project description for bond repayment calculator**: The bond repayment calculator uses the python formula repayment = (i*P)/(1 - (1+i)* *(-n)), where P= the present value of the house, i = the monthly interest rate, calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12, n = the number of months over which the bond will be repayed.
